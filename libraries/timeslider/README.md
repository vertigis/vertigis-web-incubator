# Time Slider Component

The `Time Slider` component in this library renders an [Esri Time Slider](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-TimeSlider.html) widget which enables playback of time-aware layers in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The [component](src/components/TimeSlider/TimeSlider.tsx) initializes Esri's [Time Slider JavaScript widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-TimeSlider.html) and acts as a wrapper so it can be placed anywhere in a VertiGIS Studio Web application.

The VertiGIS Studio Map component in the sample instantiates a sample VertiGIS Studio Web application with a Time Slider component pre-configured.
